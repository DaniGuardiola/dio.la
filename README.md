Welcome to my blog's source code!

## Features

- Minimalistic and clean design.
- Article highlights and filterable topics.
- Rich article content, including interactive TypeScript code snippets.
- About page with details about me :)

## Tech

- Coded in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- Built on [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/).
- Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and, in some cases, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
- Content authored using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) v2.
- Code highlighting (including interactive TypeScript blocks) powered by [`shiki-twoslash`](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/).
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) through the [`solid-start-vercel`](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/packages/start-vercel) adapter.
- Open Graph images generated with [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) on Vercel Edge Functions, through [`@vercel/og`](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation). **Note: not implemented yet (soon!).**

## Principles

- Fully accessible - try keyboard navigation (tab) or a screen reader!
- Responsive to all screen sizes.
- Lightweight, performant and optimized - near perfect [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) score.
- Search engine and social media friendly.
