Hey there!

Thanks for visiting my little blog 😊. Some quick facts about me:

- **Design system developer** and LLM tamer (among other things) at [create](https://create.xyz/).
- **Math and physics student** at UGR (University of Granada, Spain).
- Very into **music**, although I don't have much time to jam these days!
- Born and based in **Spain**. I love traveling and often work remotely from different locations.
- Always having **fun**, always **learning**, always **building**.
- Advocate for **free and open source** software and hardware, the **right to repair**, and **privacy**.
- **Kindness** over profit. **Collaboration** over competition. **Building for humans** over building for money.
