Hey there!

Thanks for visiting my little blog 😊. Some quick facts about me:

- 🎓 **Math and physics student** at UGR (University of Granada, Spain).
- 🎵 Very into **music**, although I don't have much time to jam these days!
- 🌍 Born and based in **Spain**. I love traveling and often work remotely from different locations.
- 💙 Always having **fun**, always **learning**, always **building**.
- ✊🏽 Advocate for **free and open source** software and hardware, the **right to repair**, and **privacy**.
- 🌱 **Kindness** over profit. **Collaboration** over competition. **Building for humans** over building for money.
