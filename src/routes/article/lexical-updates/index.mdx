# What is an update?

A Lexical state (`EditorState`) holds two important pieces of data: the current **node tree** and the **selection state**. This state is considered the source of truth.

The state is the source of truth for the editor, not the DOM. The DOM is computed from the state and not the other way around. A fancier way to say it is that **"the view (DOM) is a function of the state (`EditorState`)"**.

```ts twoslash
import type { EditorState } from "lexical";
declare function renderToDOM(state: EditorState): HTMLElement;
declare const editorState: EditorState;
// ---cut---
// This is pseudo code!
renderToDOM(editorState);
```

When we update the state, we are changing the node tree or the selection state. Once these changes are applied, Lexical computes the differences between the previous and new state, and applies them to the DOM in a process called "reconciliation".

```ts twoslash
import type { EditorState } from "lexical";
type DOMDiff = "imagine this is a DOM diff :)";
declare function compareStates(
  previousState: EditorState,
  newState: EditorState
): DOMDiff;
declare function applyDiffToDOM(diff: DOMDiff): void;
declare const previousState: EditorState;
declare const newState: EditorState;
// ---cut---
// This is pseudo code!
const domDiff = compareStates(previousState, newState);
applyDiffToDOM(domDiff);
```

For example, if our previous state had _three_ paragraphs, and the new one has _two_, a paragraph needs to be removed. This resembles the concept of "virtual DOM" from other projects like React, although in practice there are many differences.

---

Lexical triggers updates internally in multiple situations. Some examples:

- In response to events, like [when the user types text into the editor](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/12a045e533b19e058d98e609873832cea2e3ac85/packages/lexical/src/LexicalEvents.ts#L600).
- When `LexicalEditor.focus` is called, [in order to set the right selection state](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/12a045e533b19e058d98e609873832cea2e3ac85/packages/lexical/src/LexicalEditor.ts#L818).
- In some of the internal logic, [like the `markAllNodesAsDirty` util](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/12a045e533b19e058d98e609873832cea2e3ac85/packages/lexical/src/LexicalUtils.ts#L388).

# `editor.update()`

It is also possible to update the state manually, by calling the `LexicalEditor.update` method with a callback. Here's an example from the docs:

```ts twoslash
import {
  createEditor,
  $getRoot,
  $getSelection,
  $createParagraphNode,
  $createTextNode,
} from "lexical";
const config = {
  namespace: "MyEditor",
  theme: {},
  onError: console.error,
};
const editor = createEditor(config);
// ---cut---
editor.update(() => {
  // Get the RootNode from the EditorState.
  const root = $getRoot();

  // Create a new ParagraphNode.
  const paragraphNode = $createParagraphNode();

  // Create a new TextNode.
  const textNode = $createTextNode("Hello world");

  // Append the text node to the paragraph.
  paragraphNode.append(textNode);

  // Finally, append the paragraph to the root.
  root.append(paragraphNode);
});
```

This is one of the most important features in Lexical: the ability to **programatically update the state**.

For example, if you want to build an "insert" menu to add nodes like images or videos, you need to update the state.\*.

> \* It's likely that an actual implementation of this would dispatch a command instead of directly updating the state, but even in that case, there'll still be a listener for that command that updates the state.

---

At this point, there are a few open questions:

> ‚ùì **What are these `$` methods?** Is this PHP? jQuery?!?

> ‚ùì We're not returning anything, and we're not calling any sort of `setState` functions so... **how does the state actually get updated?**

> ‚ùì **How does `$getRoot()` know which editor to use?** There might be different editor instances in our page, but we're not passing anything to the function, so which editor root should it return?

There are really good answers to all of these questions. Spoiler alert: they're all related!

We'll get to them in a bit, but we need to lay the groundwork first.

# _Updating_ the state?

First of all: I've lied to you. Sorry about that. Let me explain.

When introducing the concept of state updates, it's easier to think of state as something that is "updated". Conceptually, that's what happens anyway.

In reality, the state is not updated: it's replaced. Every time an update happens, these are roughly the steps that are followed:

---

export const currentState = (
  <span class="text-green-700 font-bold">current state</span>
);

export const pendingState = (
  <span class="text-orange-700 font-bold">pending state</span>
);

export const updateCallback = (
  <span class="text-blue-700 font-bold">update callback</span>
);

export const checkmark = <span class="text-green-500 font-bold">‚úî</span>;

export const lock = "üîí";

- The {currentState} is **cloned**. This cloned state becomes the "{pendingState}".
- The {pendingState} becomes {checkmark} **mutable**.
  - The {updateCallback} applies its **changes** to it (in other words: it _mutates_ it).
- Once the {updateCallback} is done, the {pendingState} is {lock} **locked** (made immutable).
- The {pendingState} is set as the {currentState}, effectively replacing it.
- Reconciliation happens and the resulting changes are applied to the DOM.

---

This should be starting to make sense, but it doesn't answer our questions yet. However, it already gives us a hint of what's going on: the pending state is mutable while the update logic is running.

We still don't know exactly _how_ the pending state is mutated, but at least we know that it's possible. Let's go deeper.

# Anatomy of an update

To get a clearer picture of what's going on, let's create a simplified version of [the method that executes an update](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/12a045e533b19e058d98e609873832cea2e3ac85/packages/lexical/src/LexicalUpdates.ts#L882) in Lexical.

Here's a skeleton implementation:

```ts twoslash
import type { LexicalEditor } from "lexical";
import { cloneEditorState } from "lexical/LexicalEditorState";

let isReadOnlyMode = true;
declare function commitPendingUpdates(editor: LexicalEditor): void;
// ---cut---
export function updateEditor(editor: LexicalEditor, updateFn: () => void) {
  // Get the current state.
  const currentEditorState = editor._editorState;
  //    ^?

  // Clone the current state and set it as the pending state.
  editor._pendingEditorState = cloneEditorState(currentEditorState);

  // Enable mutability.
  isReadOnlyMode = false;

  // Execute the update callback.
  updateFn();

  // Disable mutability.
  isReadOnlyMode = true;

  // Commit pending updates.
  commitPendingUpdates(editor);
}
```

There are two distinct phases:

1. **Update phase:** the state is cloned and made mutable. The update callback is executed.
2. **Commit phase:** the new state replaces the old one, and reconciliation happens.

> **Reconciliation** is the process of comparing the current state with the pending state, and applying the necessary changes to the DOM.

The second step happens entirely inside our `commitPendingUpdates` function. Here's an extremely simplified representation of what it does:

```ts twoslash
import type { LexicalEditor, EditorState } from "lexical";
declare function reconcileDOM(
  currentState: EditorState,
  pendingState: EditorState
): void;
// ---cut---
export function commitPendingUpdates(editor: LexicalEditor) {
  // Get the current state.
  const currentState = editor._editorState;

  // Get the pending state.
  const pendingState = editor._pendingEditorState!;

  // Reconcile the DOM.
  reconcileDOM(currentState, pendingState);

  // Set the pending state as the current state.
  editor._editorState = pendingState;
}
```

# The lexical scope

Something that stands out here is the `isReadOnlyMode` variable. Where is it coming from?

The answer is very simple: it's defined at the module level. The `LexicalUpdates.ts` file contains both the `isReadOnlyMode` variable declaration and the update function:

```ts twoslash {1, 5, 7}
import type { LexicalEditor } from "lexical";
// ---cut---
let isReadOnlyMode = true;

export function updateEditor(editor: LexicalEditor, updateFn: () => void) {
  // ...
  isReadOnlyMode = false;
  // ...
  isReadOnlyMode = true;
}
```

This is useful due to **lexical scope**.

> **Do not get confused here!** When we talk about _lexical scope_, we're talking about **JavaScript lexical scope**, which is a concept entirely unrelated to _Lexical_, the text editor framework.
>
> If you're unfamiliar with scopes in JavaScript, you should [learn about them](<](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)>) before you read on.

Specifically, Lexical is taking advantage of _module scope_, which is the scope at which the variable is being declared. This means that we have access to the variable from anywhere in the module.

There's something else going on here though. If you've used Lexical before, you might have run into this error while trying to call a method like `node.insertAfter()` **outside** of an `editor.update()` callback:

```ts twoslash
import type { NodeKey } from "lexical";
import { createEditor, $getNodeByKey, $createParagraphNode } from "lexical";

const config = {
  namespace: "MyEditor",
  theme: {},
  onError: console.error,
};
const editor = createEditor(config);
declare const key: NodeKey;
const node = $getNodeByKey(key)!;
const paragraph = $createParagraphNode();
// ---cut---
// this is fine
editor.update(() => {
  node.insertAfter(paragraph);
});

// this fails
node.insertAfter(paragraph);
// error: "Cannot use method in read-only mode"
```

But how does `insertAfter()` know about the read-only mode state? `insertAfter()` is not declared in the same file as `isReadOnlyMode`, so it shouldn't have access to it... right?

We'll need to dig a bit deeper.

## Updates run synchronously

Take another look at our `updateEditor` function. Our little function is synchronous, which means that we can be sure about the order of operations. Let me illustrate this:

```ts twoslash
import type { LexicalEditor } from "lexical";
// ---cut---
let isReadOnlyMode = true;

export function updateEditor(editor: LexicalEditor, updateFn: () => void) {
  console.log(isReadOnlyMode); // > true

  isReadOnlyMode = false;
  console.log(isReadOnlyMode); // > false

  isReadOnlyMode = true;
  console.log(isReadOnlyMode); // > true
}
```

This is fairly standard stuff! The key takeaway here is that, by the time our update callback is called, `isReadOnlyMode` will be `false`, effectively signaling that the pending state is mutable at that time:

```ts twoslash {4-5}
import type { LexicalEditor } from "lexical";
// ---cut---
let isReadOnlyMode = true;

export function updateEditor(editor: LexicalEditor, updateFn: () => void) {
  isReadOnlyMode = false;
  updateFn(); // While this function runs, isReadOnlyMode is false.
  isReadOnlyMode = true;
}
```

## Module scope can be accessed externally

Modules can expose values in their scope to the outside world through `export` statements. In fact, that's their point!

```twoslash include module-one
// @module: esnext
// @filename: module-one.ts
const privateConst = "my constant";
let privateLet = "my variable";

function privateFunction() {
  // ...
}

export const publicConst = "my public constant";
export let publicLet = "my public variable";
export function publicFunction() {
  // ...
}
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: module-one
```

We can import **public** modules like this:

```ts twoslash
// @include: module-one
// ---cut---
// @filename: module-two.ts
import { publicConst, publicLet, publicFunction } from "./module-one";
```

Values that are not exported cannot be imported from other modules (they are **"private"**).

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2459
// @include: module-one
// ---cut---
// @filename: module-two.ts
import { privateConst, privateLet, privateFunction } from "./module-one";
```

---

Let's look at the `isReadOnlyMode` variable again. It's not exported, we cannot use it directly from other modules:

```ts twoslash {2, 7, 10-12}
// @errors: 2459
// @filename: LexicalUpdates.ts
let isReadOnlyMode = true; // no "export" keyword!

export function updateEditor() {}

// @filename: a-module-somewhere.ts
import { isReadOnlyMode } from "./LexicalUpdates";

function $mutateStateSomehow() {
  if (isReadOnlyMode) {
    throw new Error("Cannot use method in read-only mode");
  }
}
```

However, we can still create a function in our module that returns it. That's exactly what Lexical does:

```ts twoslash {4-6, 9, 12-14}
// @filename: LexicalUpdates.ts
let isReadOnlyMode = true;

export function isCurrentlyReadOnlyMode(): boolean {
  return isReadOnlyMode;
}

// @filename: a-module-somewhere.ts
import { isCurrentlyReadOnlyMode } from "./LexicalUpdates";

function $mutateStateSomehow() {
  if (isCurrentlyReadOnlyMode()) {
    throw new Error("Cannot use method in read-only mode");
  }
}
```

In fact, Lexical goes a step further with a function that performs this check and throws the error for us:

```ts twoslash {4-8, 11, 14}
// @noErrors
// @filename: LexicalUpdates.ts
let isReadOnlyMode = true;

export function errorOnReadOnly(): void {
  if (isReadOnlyMode) {
    throw new Error("Cannot use method in read-only mode.");
  }
}

// @filename: a-module-somewhere.ts
import { errorOnReadOnly } from "./LexicalUpdates";

function $mutateStateSomehow() {
  errorOnReadOnly();
}
```

## Module scope + synchronous execution = win

It's time to connect the dots!

In the previous section, we created `$mutateStateSomehow`. When this function is called, it checks the value of `isReadOnlyMode` from the `LexicalUpdates.ts` module.

This function is intended to be called inside of the `updateEditor` (through `editor.update()`), like this:

```ts twoslash
import {
  createEditor,
  $getRoot,
  $getSelection,
  $createParagraphNode,
  $createTextNode,
} from "lexical";
const config = {
  namespace: "MyEditor",
  theme: {},
  onError: console.error,
};
const editor = createEditor(config);
function $mutateStateSomehow() {}
// ---cut---
editor.update(() => {
  $mutateStateSomehow();
});
```

Remember, our update callback is executed synchronously, and right before `isReadOnlyMode`:

```ts twoslash {4-5}
import type { LexicalEditor } from "lexical";
// ---cut---
let isReadOnlyMode = true;

export function updateEditor(editor: LexicalEditor, updateFn: () => void) {
  isReadOnlyMode = false;
  updateFn(); // $mutateStateSomehow is executed at this point.
  isReadOnlyMode = true;
}
```

This means that, when `$mutateStateSomehow` is called, `isReadOnlyMode` will be `false`, and the error will not be thrown.

---

Lexical is exploiting these behaviors to create a "global state" of sorts, in this case to track whether the editor is in read-only mode at some point in time. Functions that wish to mutate the state can perform this check through this technique.

We can answer the first question now:

> ‚ùì **What are these `$` methods?**
>
> **\>** The `$` prefix is a convention that the Lexical team uses to denote functions that depend on the `LexicalUpdate.ts` lexical scope and, therefore, can only be called inside of the `editor.update()` callback\*.

Simple as that!

> \* Technically, there's also `editor.read()`, which depends on the lexical scope in the same way.

## Other variables

The other questions are easy to answer now. Using the same technique, we can track which **editor** and **editor state** is currently "active" (i.e. the target of the current operation).

```ts twoslash {1-3, 5, 9, 22, 35, 39-53}
import type { EditorState, LexicalEditor } from "lexical";
import { cloneEditorState } from "lexical/LexicalEditorState";
declare function commitPendingUpdates(editor: LexicalEditor): void;
// ---cut---
let isReadOnlyMode = true;
let activeEditorState: null | EditorState = null;
let activeEditor: null | LexicalEditor = null;

export function isCurrentlyReadOnlyMode(): boolean {
  return isReadOnlyMode;
}

export function getActiveEditorState(): EditorState {
  if (activeEditorState === null) {
    throw new Error(
      "Unable to find an active editor state." +
        "State helpers or node methods can only be used " +
        "synchronously during the callback of " +
        "editor.update() or editorState.read()."
    );
  }

  return activeEditorState;
}

export function getActiveEditor(): LexicalEditor {
  if (activeEditor === null) {
    throw new Error(
      "Unable to find an active editor. " +
        "This method can only be used " +
        "synchronously during the callback of " +
        "editor.update()."
    );
  }

  return activeEditor;
}

export function updateEditor(editor: LexicalEditor, updateFn: () => void) {
  const currentEditorState = editor._editorState;
  editor._pendingEditorState = cloneEditorState(currentEditorState);

  // Set lexically scoped variables.
  isReadOnlyMode = false;
  activeEditor = editor;
  activeEditorState = editor._pendingEditorState;

  // Execute the update callback.
  updateFn();

  // Reset lexically scoped variables.
  isReadOnlyMode = true;
  activeEditor = null;
  activeEditorState = null;

  // Commit pending updates.
  commitPendingUpdates(editor);
}
```

With these, the answers become clear:

> ‚ùì **How does the state actually get updated?**
>
> **\>** The active state is stored in `activeEditorState`. This state will be mutable during the `editor.update()` callback, so it can be modified. Once the callback is done, the state will be locked and

> ‚ùì **How does `$getRoot()` know which editor to use?** There might be different editor instances in our page, but we're not passing anything to the function, so which editor root should it return?
