I've always loved math, but when I was young I was a terrible student. It also didn't help that I had mediocre teachers and constant drama at home.

As an adult, years later, I decided to give math another try, and Khan Academy has been an awesome resource for me. It is great for self-paced learning and has a very nice 
"mastery" system that gamifies the process.

Below is a guide to completing 100% of the math content on Khan Academy.

# How to learn math on Khan Academy

Khan Academy has a lot of content, structured in courses that are divided into units (which are often divided into sections). Each unit typically contains a set of videos, articles and exercises.

Progress is tracked in two ways:

- **Learning resources:** Khan Academy tracks the videos you've watched and the articles you've read.
- **Mastery:** depends on the completion of exercises.

The "learning resources" progress is straightforward, and not very important overall. Don't worry about it. If you feel like you need to watch a video or read an article, do it. If you don't, don't.

## Mastery

This guide will focus on the "mastery" system, which is much more interesting.

Mastery progress depends on points awarded by your mastery of each skill. Mastery is measured by completing exercises linked to a skill.

There are two ways to encounter an exercise for a particular skill:

- Skill practice: a set of exercises focused on a specific skill. Typically around 4-8 exercises.
- Quiz or unit test: a set of exercises covering multiple skills. Typically around 1-3 exercises per skill.

Typically, each unit section ends with a quiz, and each unit ends with a unit test. Additionally, there is usually a course challenge.

A skill can be in different states:

- **Not started (0 points):** you haven't completed any exercise yet.
- **Attempted (0 points):** less than 70% correct in practice, or incorrect answer in a quiz or unit test.
- **Familiar (50 points):** more than 70% correct in practice, or correct answer in a quiz or unit test.
- **Proficient (80 points):** 100% correct in practice, or correct answer in a quiz or unit test **when the skill was already Familiar**.
- **Mastered (100 points):** correct answer in a quiz or unit test **when the skill was already Proficient**.

Another way to level up Proficient skills into Mastered is to complete a "mastery challenge", which is a set of exercises for Proficient skills. You can only complete a mastery challenge once per day, for a specific course.

To achieve 100% mastery of a unit or course, you need to get all skills to Mastered level.

## How to approach a course

If you're reading this, you're probably not at the beginning of your math journey.
