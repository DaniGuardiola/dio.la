# Hi there! :)

Hello, Twitter employee reviewing this request ðŸ‘‹

I am [@daniguardio_la](https://twitter.com/daniguardio_la) on Twitter, a software engineer and blogger trying to build my brand online. I bought this domain ("dio.la") and lovingly built this website with the hopes that it would become my brand (it's the last part of my name!).

In this brief request I wanted to politely ask you to consider giving me the [@dio_la](https://twitter.com/dio_la) account so I can use it for my brand.

This account has apparently been inactive for quite some time (since 2016 or so). With this article I prove my ownership over the "dio.la" domain.

I also have a trademark request on the way, but that will take a bit of time, so I ask you to consider giving me the account in the meantime.

I would be very grateful. Thank you for your time, and I hope you have a very nice day!
