[Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) is "an extensible [web] text editor framework that does things differently", designed to be "reliable, accessible and fast".

Lexical is built and used extensively at Meta, it "powers web text editing experiences for hundreds of millions of users every day across Facebook, Workplace, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram".

At [Guide](https://guide.co/), we've built a text editor that is at the heart of some of the core features of our product. It's no simple editor! It's packed with features like:

- Rich text: lists, links, quotes, bold, italic, etc.
- Interactive blocks: video/image/file embeds, interview schedules, etc.
- Variables/tokens.
- Mentions.
- Floating and fixed toolbars.
- A command/typeahead menu triggered by the `/` character, etc.
- Markdown-like shortcuts, like `*` for bold, `#` for headings, etc.

TODO: add demo video

We've built our editor with Lexical, which has proven to be a great choice.

I've learned many things on this journey that I want to share. I'm gonna be publishing a series of articles about Lexical ("Lexical, explained"), going over how it works and how to use it, and even looking at some of the internals.

I aim to demystify Lexical and highlight the cleverness of its design. And I also intend to share advanced and opinionated ways to architect a text editor project built on top of Lexical.

It's gonna be an in-depth dive that assumes some level of familiarity with the basics, so go read the [official documentation](https://lexical.dev/docs/intro) if you haven't done it yet.

# Lexical in a nutshell

To get things started, here are some quick fundamental facts about Lexical:

- It is **framework-agnostic**, meaning that it's not tied to any specific view framework. It can be used with React, Solid, etc, or even vanilla (framework-less). Frameworks are supported through "bindings", with only React being officially supported at the moment. There are community efforts to support other frameworks, like [Solid](https://github.com/mosheduminer/lexical-solid).
- It uses **[`contenteditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable)** under the hood, an HTML attribute that makes any HTML element editable. Lexical handles inconsistencies across different browsers and operative systems, which are unfortunately frequent with this attribute.
- It is powered by a **DOM reconciler**, which takes care of comparing the current state with the next ("pending") one and applies changes to the DOM efficiently. This resembles a "virtual DOM" (as seen in frameworks like React), optimized for text editing which makes it very efficient.

The name "Lexical", besides being a concept related to language and text, comes from the fact that it exploits JavaScript's lexical scoping in clever ways as part of its design. You'll be able to learn more about this in the upcoming article about state updates.

# Lexical, explained

With this series, I aim to cover some of the topics that I find interesting or worth deconstructing. Being exhaustive is **not** a goal, as this is not intended as a replacement for the official documentation.

## Goals

- Cover interesting topics.
- Share personal learnings and opinions.
- Deconstruct some of the architecture and design decisions.
- Keep it open-ended, with the possibility of adding new articles anytime.
- Go beyond Lexical itself, and explore how to build on top of it.

## Non-goals

- Be exhaustive.
- Replace the official documentation.
- Hold the reader's hand.
- Provide support to Lexical users.
- Be always up to date.

Each article in the series will focus on a different topic or set of related topics. I'm gonna try to be mindful of the order in which I publish them so that readers can follow along and build a mental model of how Lexical works.

That said, the best way to profit from this series is to be prepared to jump back and forth between articles (and the Lexical documentation) so that you can get the full picture and understand things deeply.

Finally, keep in mind that some of the information in these articles is likely to become outdated at some point, as Lexical is a project in active development and an unstable API. If you do find something that's no longer accurate, please let me know and I'll be happy to make an update or add a note at the top.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the series!
