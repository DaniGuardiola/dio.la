# The end is `return`

One of the first things you'll learn in JavaScript is that the `return` keyword ends a function's execution.

For instance, the extremely common "early return" pattern relies on this fact.

```ts twoslash
declare const someCondition: boolean;
declare function someOtherLogic(): void;
// ---cut---
function earlyReturn() {
  if (someCondition) return "early";

  // no "else" needed
  someOtherLogic();
}
```

This behavior has some implications. Consider the following example.

```ts twoslash
declare function getOutputValue(): "output value";
declare function someOtherLogic(): void;
// ---cut---
function doSomething() {
  return getOutputValue();

  someOtherLogic();
}
```

If you do this, `someOtherLogic` will never be called, because the function exits after the `return` statement. This is called "dead code", and some tools will even automatically remove it for you.

A common way to work around this is to store the output value to be able to return it afterwards.

```ts twoslash
declare function getOutputValue(): "output value";
declare function someOtherLogic(): void;
// ---cut---
function doSomething() {
  const result = getOutputValue();

  someOtherLogic();

  return result;
}
```

One classic example is a React context consumer which ensures the context is present.

```ts twoslash
import { useContext, type Context } from "react";
type MyContextValue = { something: string };
declare const MyContext: Context<MyContextValue | undefined>;
// ---cut---
function useMyContext() {
  const value = useContext(MyContext);

  if (!value) throw new Error("MyContext is not available");

  return value;
}
```

# Life beyond `return`

Now, consider this.

```ts twoslash
declare function getOutputValue(): "output value";
declare function someOtherLogic(): void;
// ---cut---
function doSomething() {
  try {
    return getOutputValue();
  } finally {
    someOtherLogic();
  }
}
```

Will `someOtherLogic` be called? Surprisingly, the answer is **yes**. Specifically, this is what will happen:

1. The `try` block is executed.
2. The `getOutputValue()` function is called.
3. The `finally` block is executed.
4. The `someOtherLogic()` function is called.
5. The output value of the previous `getOutputValue()` call is returned.

I found out about this after reading the source of [Lexical's `readEditorState` function](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/a0d5e95ec0371dae915b5c000e2bc68f029644d3/packages/lexical/src/LexicalUpdates.ts#L391-L410), where some cleanup logic needs to run before returning the output value.

```ts twoslash {13-19}
import type { LexicalEditor, EditorState } from "lexical";

let isReadOnlyMode = true;
let activeEditorState: null | EditorState = null;
let activeEditor: null | LexicalEditor = null;
// ---cut---
export function readEditorState<V>(
  editorState: EditorState,
  callbackFn: () => V
): V {
  const previousActiveEditorState = activeEditorState;
  const previousReadOnlyMode = isReadOnlyMode;
  const previousActiveEditor = activeEditor;

  activeEditorState = editorState;
  isReadOnlyMode = true;
  activeEditor = null;

  try {
    return callbackFn();
  } finally {
    activeEditorState = previousActiveEditorState;
    isReadOnlyMode = previousReadOnlyMode;
    activeEditor = previousActiveEditor;
  }
}
```

Is this a good idea? I don't know. It's definitely clever, but it's also a bit surprising.

# Bonus: `return` in `finally`

Can you guess what will be logged when the following code runs?

```ts twoslash
function doSomething() {
  try {
    return "try";
  } finally {
    return "finally";
  }
}

console.log(doSomething());
```

The answer is `"finally"`. The `return` in the `finally` block overrides the `return` in the `try` block.

Stay weird, JavaScript.
